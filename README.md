# Motor-Project
3rd Year UBC Design project. 

Objective: Design a system of two motors to control a laser to draw various shapes fast enough to look like a complete image. The motors must be hand-built and controlled with a PID controller. 

Files are organized as follows:

1. Elec391_Project_Gen_1 -> Initial PCB
2. Elec391_Project_Gen_2 -> Revised PCB 
3. Elec391_Project_Software -> Arduino Code and GUI 
4. Tests -> Arduino Code to run various tests on Motor. These are flashed onto the Arduino and then run using main.py in Data
5. Data -> Data logger code and output 
6. Matlab and Simulink -> Various models and Matlab scripts
7. Speed Tests -> A series of tests conducted on the custom motors to see how fast they can go! 
8. Encoder -> Mechanical design of test rig 
9. ControlSlideDeck-B10.pdf: Final presentation
